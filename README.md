# No-Show-Appointments
## Data Description
In this project, analysis would be done on information from a dataset containing 100k medical appointments in Brazil. Factors that determine whether the patients show up for their appointments or not would be looked at. Exploration will be done on how factors like Diabetes, Hypertension, Handicap, Alcoholism, SMS notification and Scholarship affect how patients show up for their appointments.
## Questions for Analysis
- Is Gender a significant factor to determine the appointment attendance?
- Is Age a significant factor to determine the appointment attendance?
- Is Hypertension a significant factor to determine the appointment attendance? 
- Is Diabetes a significant factor to determine the appointment attendance?
- Is Handicap a significant factor to determine the appointment attendance?
- Is Alcoholism a significant factor to determine the appointment attendance? 
- Is receiving a SMS a significant factor to determine the appointment attendance?
## Analysis
After careful exploration, the following observations were made:
- There are more female patients than male patients.
- Teenagers and youths are less likely to show up for their appointments than other age groups (Baby, Child, Adult, Old and Elderly).
- Hypertensive patients show up more for their appointments than patients who are not hypertensive.
- Diabetic patients attend their appointments than non-diabetic patients but the difference is not too significant.
- Albeit more, the difference between the number of handicap patients and the non-handicap patients that show up for their appointment is not too significant.
- There is no difference in the percentage between the alcholic patients and non-alcoholic patient that show up for their appointments.
- Patients that did not receive sms attended their appointments than patients that received sms.
## Conclusion
- Gender is not a signifant factor to determine if patients will show up for their appointments.
- Age may be a signifant factor to determine if patients will show up for their appointments.
- Hypertension may be a signifant factor to determine if patients will show up for their appointments.
- Diabetes may not be a signifant factor to determine if patients will show up for their appointments.
- Handicap may not be a signifant factor to determine if patients will show up for their appointments.
- Alcoholism is not a signifant factor to determine if patients will show up for their appointments.
- Receving SMS may be a signifant factor to determine if patients will show up for their appointments.
## Limitation
- There was a negative value in the age column which had to be replaced.
- The factors analyzed were collated as integers and had to be changed to boolean values.
